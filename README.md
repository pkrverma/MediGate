# MediGate: Gateway to Confidential Healthcare Data

## Decentralized personal health record application

The project uses blockchain and smart contracts to let individuals manage and secure their health data. The Project's goal is to empower people to control their health information, communicate better with healthcare providers, and drive innovation in healthcare.

### The problem DECENTRALIZED PERSONAL HEALTH RECORD APPLICATION solves

&nbsp;

-Presently, hospitals keep patients' vital medical information using antiquated techniques, which makes it indirectly vulnerable to theft and other threats.

-Given the sensitive nature of medical data, data sharing and privacy preservation present significant issues in centralized digital health records systems.

-To create a decentralized application that is private, safe, and gives medical professionals a solid solution to protect patient privacy while keeping track of medical history.

-To create a more patient-centric system in which health records are only shared with physicians upon the request of the patient.

-To create a system that, in an emergency, saves and shows the patient's medical information in order to save time.

-Safeguard patient data storage: The decentralized structure of blockchain technology will guarantee that patient data is kept safe and unalterable, shielding it from hacker access or breaches.

-Enable data sharing: In compliance with patient consent and data protection laws, the system would permit researchers and authorized healthcare professionals to access and share patient data.

-Enhance data interoperability: By allowing the exchange of patient data between various healthcare systems and organizations, the system would enhance medical research and continuity of care.

-Automate healthcare-related tasks: Medical billing, claims processing, and medical research might all be automated with the help of smart contracts on the blockchain.

-Give patients control over their data: By using digital identity and consent management systems, patients will be able to govern and control who has access to their personal health information (PHI).

-Therefore, a "Decentralized Medical data sharing & storage application based on blockchain" is the answer to improving the hospital's digital health system.
